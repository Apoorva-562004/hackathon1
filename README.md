# Real-Time Smart Traffic Management System

This project is an Intelligent Traffic Optimization System built using React for the frontend, Azure for deployment, Mapbox for mapping, and Cosmos DB for data storage.

## Overview

An Intelligent Traffic Optimization System designed to improve urban traffic flow using IoT sensors and real-time data analytics. This system helps reduce congestion by suggesting optimized routes based on real-time conditions.

## Features

- **Real-time Traffic Monitoring**: The system uses IoT sensors to monitor traffic conditions in real-time.
- **Traffic Optimization**: Through real-time data analytics, the system identifies congestion points and suggests optimal routes to reduce congestion.
- **Data Storage and Analysis**: Data collected from IoT sensors is stored in CosmosDB and analyzed to identify trends and patterns in traffic flow.


## Usage

- **Traffic Monitoring**: View real-time traffic conditions on the map.
- **Route Optimization**: Get suggested optimal routes to avoid congestion.
- **Data Analysis**: Access historical traffic data and analytics.

## Deployment

The application is deployed on Azure for scalability and reliability. To deploy the application on Azure, follow these steps:

Step 1: Set Up Azure Resources
Step 2: Backend Deployment (Node.js + Express.js)
Step 3: Frontend Deployment (React + Mapbox)
Step 4: IoT Data Processing Setup
Step 5: API & Security Setup
Step 6: Monitoring & Optimization

## Technology

•	Frontend: React.js (for user interface & visualization)
•	Backend: Node.js + Express.js (for API & data processing)
•	Database: Azure Cosmos DB (for traffic data storage)
•	Mapping: Mapbox (for real-time traffic visualization)
•	Cloud Platform: Azure
•	IoT Integration: Azure IoT Hub (for real-time sensor data collection)
